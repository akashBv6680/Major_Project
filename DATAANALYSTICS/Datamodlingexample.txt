Here's a simple example of data modeling:

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for an Online Shopping System

Entities:

- Customer
- Order
- Product
- Payment Method

Attributes:

- Customer:
    - Customer ID (primary key)
    - Name
    - Email
    - Password
- Order:
    - Order ID (primary key)
    - Customer ID (foreign key)
    - Order Date
    - Total Amount
- Product:
    - Product ID (primary key)
    - Name
    - Price
    - Description
- Payment Method:
    - Payment Method ID (primary key)
    - Customer ID (foreign key)
    - Payment Type (e.g., credit card, PayPal)

Relationships:

- A customer can make many orders (one-to-many).
- An order is made by one customer (many-to-one).
- An order can have many products (many-to-many).
- A product can be part of many orders (many-to-many).
- A customer can have many payment methods (one-to-many).

Data Model:

This data model captures the key entities, attributes, and relationships in an online shopping system. It helps to:

- Understand the data structures and relationships
- Identify data dependencies and constraints
- Design a database schema
- Support business processes and analytics

This is a simplified example, but data modeling can be applied to various domains and systems, and can become more complex depending on the specific requirements.
