Data modeling refers to the process of creating a conceptual representation of data structures and relationships to support business processes and analytics. It involves:

1. Entity-Relationship Modeling: Identifying entities (tables), attributes (columns), and relationships between them.
2. Data Warehousing: Designing a centralized repository for integrated data from various sources.
3. Dimensional Modeling: Creating a schema for analytical purposes, using fact tables and dimension tables.
4. Data Governance: Establishing policies, procedures, and standards for data management and quality.
5. Data Quality: Ensuring accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data.
6. Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources into a unified view.
7. Data Transformation: Converting data from one format to another for analysis or storage.
8. Data Visualization: Representing data in a graphical format for insights and decision-making.

Data modeling is essential for:

- Supporting business intelligence and analytics
- Improving data quality and consistency
- Enhancing data security and governance
- Facilitating data integration and interoperability
- Optimizing data storage and performance

Some common data modeling techniques include:

- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
- Unified Modeling Language (UML)

- Relational Modeling
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
