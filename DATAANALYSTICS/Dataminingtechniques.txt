Data mining techniques are methods used to discover patterns, relationships, and insights from large datasets. Here are some common data mining techniques:

1. Classification: Predicting a categorical label or class for a new instance (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).
2. Clustering: Grouping similar instances into clusters based on their characteristics (e.g., customer segmentation).
3. Regression: Predicting a continuous value or range (e.g., predicting house prices).
4. Association Rule Mining: Finding relationships between variables (e.g., products often bought together).
5. Decision Trees: Building a tree-like model to classify or predict outcomes.
6. Random Forest: Combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
7. Text Mining: Extracting insights from unstructured text data (e.g., sentiment analysis).
8. Neural Networks: Modeling complex relationships using artificial neural networks.
9. K-Means: Clustering data points into K clusters based on their similarities.
10. Naive Bayes: Classifying instances using Bayes' theorem.
11. Gradient Boosting: Combining multiple weak models to create a strong predictor.
12. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality while preserving variability.
13. Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual or outlier data points.
14. Recommendation Systems: Suggesting products or services based on user behavior and preferences.
15. Web Mining: Extracting insights from web data, such as usage patterns and user behavior.

These techniques are used in various applications, including:

- Fraud detection
- Customer behavior analysis
- Market basket analysis
- Image and speech recognition
- Predictive maintenance
- Healthcare research
