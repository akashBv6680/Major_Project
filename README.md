roject Title: Predicting Semiconductor Manufacturing Yield using Sensor Data


Objective: Develop a classifier to predict Pass/Fail yield in semiconductor manufacturing processes using sensor data, and analyze the relevance of 591 features in the dataset.


Dataset: "sensor-data.csv" containing 1567 examples with 591 features, including signal variable data and labels indicating Pass/Fail yield.


Methodology:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
2. Testing and evaluating multiple classification algorithms.
3. Feature selection to identify essential signals impacting yield.
4. Data visualization to illustrate key findings.


Goals:

1. Develop an accurate classifier for predicting Pass/Fail yield.
2. Identify the most relevant features contributing to yield prediction.
3. Provide insights into the relationships between sensor data and yield outcomes.
